Yet, historical evidence for leafminer outbreaks is limited. We combined leafminer larval surveys conducted between 1950 and 1992 with tree-ring analyses from eight cedar stands to reconstruct a history of leafminer outbreaks in Maine, USA. Our tree-ring data show distinctive 2- to 3-year growth reductions that we attribute to leafminers. Several such growth reductions correspond to peak leafminer larval abundances, providing evidence that the reductions are reliable indicators of leafminer activity. Outbreak severity within a site was unrelated to cedar abundance. Outbreak periods thus identified (beginning ca. 1919, 1937, 1950, 1962, mid-1970s, but not at all sites) suggest that leafminer damage may have been more prevalent (albeit patchy) than previously thought. This historical information is relevant given current outbreaks in Maine and elsewhere. </jats:p>",,,,,,,"Fraver S, Bosely-Smith C, Seirup C, Guiterman CH, Schmeelk T, Teets A, Van Kampen R, Kenefic LS",,,,10.1139/cjfr-2023-0193,,,1208-6037,,,,,,,,,0045-5067,4,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,,en,,,,,,,,,,479,485,,,,,2024-04-01,Published,,Canadian Science Publishing,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2023-0193,2024-04-01,,,,,"Dendrochronological reconstruction of arborvitae leafminer (<i>Argyresthia</i> spp.) outbreaks on northern white-cedar (<i>Thuja occidentalis</i>) in Maine, USA",,54,,,Canadian Journal of Forest Research (0045-5067),A,Canadian Journal of Forest Research (0045-5067),0.969,Canadian Journal of Forest Research (0045-5067),0.956,No,,10.1139/cjfr-2023-0193,Crossref,Canadian Journal of Forest Research

333155,Journal article,01/08/2023,,"<jats:p>The longleaf pine ( Pinus palustris Mill.) and related ecosystem is an icon of the southeastern United States (US). Once covering an estimated 37 million ha from Texas to Florida to Virginia, the near-extirpation of, and subsequent restoration efforts for, the species has been well-documented over the past ca. 100 years. Although longleaf pine is one of the longest-lived tree species in the southeastern US—with documented ages of over 400 years—its use has not been reviewed in the field of dendrochronology. In this paper, we review the utility of longleaf pine tree-ring data within the applications of four primary, topical research areas: climatology and paleoclimate reconstruction, fire history, ecology, and archeology/cultural studies. Further, we highlight knowledge gaps in these topical areas, for which we introduce the Longleaf Tree-Ring Network (LTRN). The overarching purpose of the LTRN is to coalesce partners and data to expand the scientific use of longleaf pine tree-ring data across the southeastern US. As a first example of LTRN analytics, we show that the development of seasonwood chronologies (earlywood width, latewood width, and total width) enhances the utility of longleaf pine tree-ring data, indicating the value of these seasonwood metrics for future studies. We find that at 21 sites distributed across the species’ range, latewood width chronologies outperform both their earlywood and total width counterparts in mean correlation coefficient (RBAR = 0.55, 0.46, 0.52, respectively). Strategic plans for increasing the utility of longleaf pine dendrochronology in the southeastern US include [1] saving remnant material ( e.g., stumps, logs, and building construction timbers) from decay, extraction, and fire consumption to help extend tree-ring records, and [2] developing new chronologies in LTRN spatial gaps to facilitate broad-scale analyses of longleaf pine ecosystems within the context of the topical groups presented.</jats:p>",,,,,,,"Harley GL, Therrell MD, Maxwell JT, Bhuta A, Bregy JC, Heeter KJ, Patterson T, Rochner M, Rother MT, Stambaugh M",,,,10.1177/03091333221147652,,,1477-0296,,,,,,,,,0309-1333,4,Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment,,en,,,,,,,,2023-01-02,,570,596,,,,,2023-08,Published,,SAGE Publications,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03091333221147652,2023-12-03,,,,,The Longleaf Tree-Ring Network: Reviewing and expanding the utility of<i>Pinus palustris</i>Mill.

328009,Journal article,01/07/2022,,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Fire regimes in North American forests are diverse and modern fire records are often too short to capture important patterns, trends, feedbacks, and drivers of variability. Tree‐ring fire scars provide valuable perspectives on fire regimes, including centuries‐long records of fire year, season, frequency, severity, and size. Here, we introduce the newly compiled North American tree‐ring fire‐scar network (NAFSN), which contains 2562 sites, &gt;37,000 fire‐scarred trees, and covers large parts of North America. We investigate the NAFSN in terms of geography, sample depth, vegetation, topography, climate, and human land use. Fire scars are found in most ecoregions, from boreal forests in northern Alaska and Canada to subtropical forests in southern Florida and Mexico. The network includes 91 tree species, but is dominated by gymnosperms in the genus <jats:italic>Pinus</jats:italic>. Fire scars are found from sea level to &gt;4000‐m elevation and across a range of topographic settings that vary by ecoregion. Multiple regions are densely sampled (e.g., &gt;1000 fire‐scarred trees), enabling new spatial analyses such as reconstructions of area burned. To demonstrate the potential of the network, we compared the climate space of the NAFSN to those of modern fires and forests; the NAFSN spans a climate space largely representative of the forested areas in North America, with notable gaps in warmer tropical climates. Modern fires are burning in similar climate spaces as historical fires, but disproportionately in warmer regions compared to the historical record, possibly related to under‐sampling of warm subtropical forests or supporting observations of changing fire regimes. The historical influence of Indigenous and non‐Indigenous human land use on fire regimes varies in space and time. A 20th century fire deficit associated with human activities is evident in many regions, yet fire regimes characterized by frequent surface fires are still active in some areas (e.g., Mexico and the southeastern United States). These analyses provide a foundation and framework for future studies using the hundreds of thousands of annually‐ to sub‐annually‐resolved tree‐ring records of fire spanning centuries, which will further advance our understanding of the interactions among fire, climate, topography, vegetation, and humans across North America.</jats:p>",,,,,,,"Margolis EQ, Guiterman CH, Chavardès RD, Coop JD, Copes‐Gerbitz K, Dawe DA, Falk DA, Johnston JD, Larson E, Li H",,,,10.1002/ecs2.4159,,,2150-8925,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,7,Ecosphere,,en,,,,,,,,2022-07-12,,,,,,,,2022-07,Published,,Wiley,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4159,2023-08-23,,,,,The North American tree‐ring fire‐scar network,,13,,,,,Ecosphere (2150-8925),1.461,Ecosphere (2150-8925),0.951,Yes,CC BY,10.1002/ecs2.4159,Crossref,Ecosphere

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Forest and nonforest ecosystems of the western United States are experiencing major transformations in response to land-use change, climate warming, and their interactive effects with wildland fire. Some ecosystems are transitioning to persistent alternative types, hereafter called “vegetation type conversion” (VTC). VTC is one of the most pressing management issues in the southwestern US, yet current strategies to intervene and address change often use trial-and-error approaches devised after the fact. To better understand how to manage VTC, we gathered managers, scientists, and practitioners from across the southwestern US to collect their experiences with VTC challenges, management responses, and outcomes.</jats:p>
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Participants in two workshops provided 11 descriptive case studies and 61 examples of VTC from their own field observations. These experiences demonstrate the extent and complexity of ecological reorganization across the region. High-severity fire was the predominant driver of VTC in semi-arid coniferous forests. By a large margin, these forests converted to shrubland, with fewer conversions to native or non-native herbaceous communities. Chaparral and sagebrush areas nearly always converted to non-native grasses through interactions among land use, climate, and fire. Management interventions in VTC areas most often attempted to reverse changes, although we found that these efforts cover only a small portion of high-severity burn areas undergoing VTC. Some areas incurred long (&gt;10 years) observational periods prior to initiating interventions. Efforts to facilitate VTC were rare, but could cover large spatial areas.</jats:p>

                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Our findings underscore that type conversion is a common outcome of high-severity wildland fire in the southwestern US. Ecosystem managers are frontline observers of these far-reaching and potentially persistent changes, making their experiences valuable in further developing intervention strategies and research agendas. As its drivers increase with climate change, VTC appears increasingly likely in many ecological contexts and may require management paradigms to transition as well. Approaches to VTC potentially include developing new models of desired conditions, the use of experimentation by managers, and broader implementation of adaptive management strategies. Continuing to support and develop science-manager partnerships and peer learning groups will help to shape our response to ongoing rapid ecological transformations.</jats:p>

               <jats:p>Every year, millions of hectares burn across Siberia, driven by a combination of warming temperatures, regional drought and human-caused ignitions. Dendrochronology provides a long-term context to evaluate recent trends in fire activity and interpret the relative influence of humans and climate drivers on fire regimes. We developed a 400 year record of fire-scarred trees from 17 sites in pine-dominated forests located southeast of Lake Baikal. Site-level mean fire return intervals (MFIs) ranged from 4 to 27 years for all fires and 8 to 35 years for widespread fires within sites. Sites with the lowest MFI values were located within 1 km of agricultural fields in grassland valleys, suggesting that agricultural burning influenced MFIs at nearby sites. Fire frequency varied over the record, with significantly high values around 1790, from 1865 to 1880, 1948 to 1955 and 1995 to 2005. The increased fire activity corresponded with migration waves to the region and major socio-economic change connected with the establishment and breakdown of the Soviet Union. At broader scales, superposed epoch analysis showed that synchronous fire years were associated with regional drought and precipitation deficits. Wet conditions for 2–3 years prior to the event year were also significant, suggesting that increased moisture promoted growth of understory fine fuels to support more extensive fires across the study area. Although fire frequencies increased during the 20th century, fire–climate relationships weakened, suggesting increased human-caused ignitions may override regional climate drivers. Our dataset presents a continuous record of frequent surface fires over the past 400 years, providing a valuable opportunity to compare dendrochronology-based reconstructions with satellite and documentary records.</jats:p>",,,,,,,"Bigio ER, Swetnam TW, Baisan CH, Guiterman CH, Kisilyakhov YK, Andreev SG, Batotsyrenov EA, Ayurzhanaev AA",,,,10.1088/1748-9326/ac6964,,,1748-9326,,,,,,,,,,5,Environmental Research Letters,,,,,,,,,,2022-05-09,,054043,054043,,,,,2022-05-01,Published,,IOP Publishing,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac6964,2022-05-09,,,,,"The influence of land-use activities and regional drought on historical fire regimes of Buryatia, Siberia",,17,,,Environmental Research Letters (1748-9326),B,Environmental Research Letters (1748-9318),2.628,Environmental Research Letters (1748-9326),1.538,Yes,CC BY,10.1088/1748-9326/ac6964,Crossref,Environmental Research Letters
